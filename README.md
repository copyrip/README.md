Repository for my master thesis @[erg](https://erg.be) due in september 2022.

This body of work consists in severals shows[0] about various micro media history events. A subjective documentation of the tools needed to produce the lectures is written alongside their content. And a foreword from the author.

The tools are presented in a subjective humorous manner, as not to duplicate their full documentation, as it is usually readily available.

Everyday after waking up,
I light up my Lenovo ThinkPad T410,
    it is rocking an Intel i5 CPU
arch linux boots up
    it uses systemd, grub?, and sooo much other deamons
a custom script prompts me on "how am i feeling today"
firefox launches on the i3 space n°2
signal lanches on the i3 space n°9

when i'm looking for something
    i press cmd+2 → ctrl+t
    "my question", and usually !g
        duckduckgo asks google "my question"
        as the results appear I press f
        vim vixen appends a combination of letter (from A to ZZ) on every link it finds
        i press the corresponding letters to open the page that might contain my an answer to "my question"
```

## notes
[0] The 'shows' are hybrid performances both similar as *in-person* lectures and broadcasted online as a streaming video.
