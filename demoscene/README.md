    As we still struggle with covid presence.

CAPITALISM ON KETAMINE

TECHNO OPTIMISM

I'm heading out. I start by inserting my analog wired earpieces into my ears. Then I put on my black chirurgical mask, a scarf above my head and a simple Decathlon cap. A black one. Do I take my fast-charging enable 24W double USB (with 2.4A each) 220V to 5V transformer (and its obligatory usb to usb-c plug.s) ? Do I take my external Intenso battery pack wtih XX capacity and my butterfly sticker bought from Aktion watermark ? Do I have enough 6mg home mixed vape juice for it to be worth
to bring along my OBS and MadHatter (discontinued) atomizer ?
