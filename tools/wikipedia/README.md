Wikipedia.com is one of the website I use the most (just after google search via duckduckgo, I guess).

Many years ago, I remember precisely teachers forbidding us to use wikipedia as source for our homeworks, stating that "anybody can write anything on these websites". Well, how the turntables have turned ! 

Mediawiki is the software behind the encyclopedia, and also powers non-a website, wiki fandom, and our beloved erg cryptic site. A wiki is an horizontal form of information organisation, production, consumption.

Today we celebrate the 21 years of this amazing project that was created by two distinct individuals.

Larry Sanger is an ex-founder in his bio, and insists by adding that he is "long gone from WP".

What the hell is an ex-founder anyways ? As if you could erase your past and not have founded something.
