Wikipedia.com is one of the website I use the most (just after google search via duckduckgo, I guess).

Many years ago, I remember precisely teachers forbidding us to use wikipedia as source for our homeworks, stating that "anybody can write anything on these websites". Well, how the turntables have turned ! 

Mediawiki is the software behind the encyclopedia, and also powers non-a website, wiki fandom, and our beloved erg cryptic website.
