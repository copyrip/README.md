VLC media player is an amazing french built free and open source software.

The player is part of the french "Socle interministériel de logiciels libres" which roughly transcribes to Interministerial *Libre* Software Baselist. As much as I love lists, I'm not fond of governments. But I find it quite funny to imagine thoses boomer struggling with their CUPS printer lists.

Did you know you can buy VLC on ebay for 5$ ? I guess if someone suscribe to my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/copyright_) I'll buy one and try it !

I mentionned Big Buck Bunny earlier (see youtube-dl): turns out it's also used to display VLC Android client.

You can find a lot of (digital) goodies on their website, as reminder of a time where customizing your desktop icons was a more common goal.
