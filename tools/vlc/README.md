VLC media player is an amazing french built free and open source software.

The player is part of the french "Socle interminist√©riel de Logiciels Libres" which roughly transcribes to Interministerial *Libre* Software Baselist. As much as I love lists, I'm not fond of governments. But I find it quite funny to imagine thoses boomer struggling with their CUPS printer lists configuration

Did you know you can buy VLC on ebay for 5$ ? I guess if someone suscribe to my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/copyright_) I'll buy one and try it !

I mentionned Big Buck Bunny earlier (see youtube-dl): turns out it's also used to display VLC Android client.

You can find a lot of (digital) goodies on their website, as reminder of a time where customizing your desktop icons was a more common goal.

The software can read from a MASSIVE amount of formats

And btw, remember DVD regions ? Well as VLC can decode them all, the software might not be legal under the infamous Digital Millenial Copyright Act that's been enforcing the laughable "CAPITALISM DRIVES INNOVATION" mindset for more than 20 years.
