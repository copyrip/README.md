"I use arch btw"

My daily driver since 4 years ! I had to give this distro some love. Arch linux is an open source linux distribution, you can think of it as an alternive to Mac OS or Windows 10. 

It was started in 2001 by Judd Vinet as "a small little project". If you're also into tools and computers, you might find his interview on usesthis.com (a great ressource) quite insightful.

There isnt much to say about arch though, it is so barebones that it can only survive inside an organicaly complex open source software environement: i3, tmux, x, systemd and such...

This linux distribution is intended to people wanting to learn more about their tools, to understant whats going on under the hood. As it is quite light (it doens't even come with a browser !), you can use it to run on older machines such as the sexy IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads.

You can find so much information about arch, linux and UNIX computing in general on their wiki, it's a gold mine.
