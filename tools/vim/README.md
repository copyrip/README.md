vim might be the top contender of this advent calender. I'm using it right now to write this post. I'm using it everyday I can. And I try to convert people (dev mostly) to use it as much as I can.

This is actually a charityware (or careware)(meaning it encourages its user to donate to a charity, in this case helping aids-caused orphans in Uganda).

I'm not going to partake in the debat opposing vim to emacs, nor try to reinvent the decade-old joke about exiting vim (it's `esc` then `:q`, all simply, q stands for quit 🤦)

Vim actually makes me WANT to write ! There's no better feeling in the world than learning a new Vim way to facilitate a tedious and repetititve tasks

Here are some of my favorites *shortcuts*
* g g = ↑ G
* d ↑ G


When I feel overwhelmed by the vastness and the speed of the world I can access through my computer,spending few keystrokes in vim feels both medidative and productive. After a period of trial an error, it can become kind of a second nature. 

Once you start manipulating text as fast without the mouse, you start wondering why the hell would you need one in any kind of software.

For Firefox, I'm using Vimvixen, there are plugins available for Chromium users as well.

On twitter, and many other sites, you can navigate content using the four nav keys of the apocalypse (̉̉̉← h, ↓ j, ↑ k, → l)



On a side-note, appreciate the fact that Alexandre Astier uses vim. But for what ?
