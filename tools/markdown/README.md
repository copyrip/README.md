*As today we honor the tragic death of Aaron Swarz, I could have share a lot of things: RSS, Wikipedia, Reddit, or even some of his texts...* But today we'll talk about Markdown.

## what is markdown ?
Markdown is a minimal formatting markup language. Ever stumbled accross a file ending with a `.md` extension ? Yup, that's markdown.

It is a shame we can no longer use this kind of tools here (see the FIGlet post for instance). But there is online place where markdown is still common such as:
* Github
* Reddit
* and of course our beloved Wikipedia !
* (many more of course)


These kind of tools (or *standards* in this case) help us rethink design, and overall information production, distribution and consomation.

> Apparently the co?creator of Markdown, Josh Gruber, states that Aaron was rather his muse at the time than the actual co-whatever. This doesn't change much though.
