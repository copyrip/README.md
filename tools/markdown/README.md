🪦 *As today we honor the tragic death of Aaron Swarz, I could have share a lot of things: RSS, Wikipedia, Reddit, or even some of his texts...* But today we'll talk about Markdown. 📝

## what is markdown ?
Markdown is a minimal formatting markup language. Ever stumbled across a file ending with a `.md` extension ? 🤔 Yup, that's markdown. It uses readily keyboard available characters (`#`, `*`, `>`, `[, `]`) to enforce hierarchy in a text Being software agnostic, you can use it anywhere, even on paper ! 🗞️

It is a shame we can no longer use this kind of tools here (see the FIGlet post for instance) 🖕 But there is online place where markdown is still common such as:
* Github 🐙
* Reddit 👽
* Stackoverflow 💡
* and of course our beloved Wikipedia ! 🌐
* (many more of course)

> Apparently the co?creator of Markdown, Josh Gruber, states that Aaron was rather his muse at the time than the actual co-whatever. This doesn't change much though. 🥱

On a side note, there are plenty of markdown flavor 🍦: wiki, github, multi markdown and more... There are/were standardization efforts, like CommonMark, among which team we can find Jeff Atwood, one of my computer idols 🙏

These kind of tools (or *standards* in this case) help us rethink design, and overall information production, distribution and consumption. Using markdown is an alternative to design and coding style waves. It provides a bridge between *power users* that rely on command line interfaces and *users* bathed in a bootstrap vectorial consumerist world. ✊
