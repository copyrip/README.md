Good Time is a simple pomodoro timer 🍅
I guess that you might be familiar with this technique, as you might be a cogwheel of this big capitalist machine that taunts us constantly to increase our so called "productivity" 🤸 (if ur not, it justs consists in setting timers in order to focus on a specific task, then take a small break, re-focus on the task, repeating that until you take a longer break 😤 With an usual ratio of 25mn of work and 5mn of *break* ☕)

## What IS productivity anyway ? 🤔
"Productivity is a crucial factor in the production performance of firms and nations." states my favorite website... Imo it's kind of a way to quantify how much you produce, how much you work 💪
So, can I use productivity techniques for something else than icreasing my country GDP ? Is it like posting anticapitalist content while using a product of said capitalism (say an iPhone), trying to destroy the master's house with its own tools 🏚️ Or posting about free software on proprietary and data captive social networks... 🤐

In a way, focus is a great defense against attention capitalism 👀 On a daily basis, I use signal discord whatsapp sms matrix messenger twitter instagram email github 🌬️ many reasons to be notified out of a worksession 🙄. But after timing my *work*, I started timing other activities such as reading,leisure, gaming, or even alcool consumption and meeting people, "déformation professionelle" I suppose 🤷

🔍 If your into data visualisation, and self quantization, know that you can export all your timed data in a `.csv` table. You can also set up different time ratio ⌛
