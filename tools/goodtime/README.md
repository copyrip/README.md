Good Time is a simple pomodoro timer.
I guess that you might be familiar with this technique, as you might be a cogwheel of this big capitalist machine that taunts us constantly to increase our so called "productivity"... (if ur not, it justs consists in setting timers in order to focus on a specific task, then take a small break, re-focus on the task, repeating that until you take a longer break)

## What IS productivity anyway ?
"Productivity is a crucial factor in the production performance of firms and nations." states my favorite website... Imo it's kind of a way to quantify how much you produce, how much you work.
So, can I use productivity techniques for something else than icreasing my country GDP ? Is it like posting anticapitalist content while using a product of said capitalism (say an iPhone), trying to destroy the master's house with its own tools. Or posting about free software on proprietary and data captive social networks...

In a way, focus is a great defense against attention capitalism. On a daily basis, I use signal discord whatsapp sms matrix messenger twitter instagram email github, many reasons to be notified out of a worksession. But after timing my *work*, I started timing other activities such as reading,leisure, gaming, or even alcool consumption and meeting people.

If your into data visualisation, and self quantization, know that you can export all your timed data in a `.csv` table. Set up different time ratio (the classic pomodoro alternating between 25 minute of work and 5 min pauses.
