🌃 Aurora is an alternative to the G\*ogle Play store, but you can find all of your favorites apps on it (unlike F-droid which we discussed last week).

Why would anyone care ? 🧐

Google is the main adverstising provider of the world 🌐, when TikTok, Apple or whatever want to advertise you something, they ask Google. The very act of downloading an app gives Google a clue of what ad is the best for you... so if you download TikTok (or any app for that matter) on the Aurora Store, Google wouldn't know you had it.
Hence, as I scroll Instagram or am forced to watch an ad to remove a watermark from a fremium app 🤑, I often get TikTok advertising. As I already use that service, the advertising has a minimal effect on me 🤷

Aurora aims to reduce the scope of information Google has on you.
It also gives information about potential trackers found on the app code,  a blacklist to *hide* apps from your phone, and a device spoofing option (simulate like you own another device so you can dowload restricted content). The dev team behind Aurora also built an F-droid client, with a smoother interface, but I don't understand the point though 😶‍🌫️  You can also find open source software (mainly F-droid repository) on the Aurora Store !

We can read on their website "Unlike Google's Play Store, Aurora Store doesn't track your downloads or the apps you use. We respect your privacy. Aurora Store is also unaffected by Google marking your device as uncertified or lacking of necessary Google apps. Play Protect is not present, as this is a Play Store only feature." 🛡️

Not much more to say about this software.
Reclaim your tools, you bought your phone, you're supposed to OWN IT ✊! Install wathever u want, break it, unistall what you don't need and configure it to your pleasing 💅 I don't want to live in a homogeneous hell where even computers are being IKEAZED 🪑 💙

My dream computer world holds plethora of "app stores", lists containing quirky and freaky software, big and small, productive and unproductive 🌻
