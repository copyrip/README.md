[F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org/) is an alternative software repository for Android phones. It\'s supposed to host only Free Libre and Open Source Software ([FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)). It was built in 2010 by [Ciaran Gultnieks](https://ciarang.com/), who is responsible for an old-school CD-rom space flight game with a sexy name:  [\"Hardwar: The Future is Greedy\"](https://ciarang.com/hardwar/) ([see last cover](https://archive.org/details/HardwarUSA/Box1.jpg)) üëæ

I wanted to introduce this alternative to üëø G\*ogle Pl\*y St\*re as some tools I\'ll be showcasing soon can be installed from [F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org/). You can also find \"major\" applications, but it\'ll display a notice about privacy concerns, trackers, or non-free code libraries if they include some (you can download a üõ©Ô∏è [Telegram client](https://www.f-droid.org/fr/packages/org.telegram.messenger/) for example even if it\'s not reaaalllllllllyyyyy free software). 

But\... don\'t expect to find League Of Legends\' Wild Rift nor Raid Shadow Legends ‚öîÔ∏è. There are plenty of nice utilities, but when it comes to
games, well\... you can find your usual üêß [Tux](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_Racer) apps and some intimate software but that\'s all. **Just to give a bit of perspective F-Droid lists over 3,800 applications while Google Play Store haz around 3 MILLIONS APPS üò±** 

It\'s quite easy to install, just go to [https://f-droid.org/](https://www.f-droid.org/) and download the [.apk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package) file üìÅ(Android Application Package, think of a mobile phone .exe or .dmg). Then, click on the \"Download Complete\" notification and you\'re all set ! On some phones you want to allow installing .apk from unknown sources, as G\*ogle obviously doesn\'t want you to leave their Pl\*y St\*re [panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon) ü§¨ Oh, did

I mention it was ONLY for Android ? üçé Sorry Apple stans\... but if you put more than a thousand dollars in a mobile phone you obviously CAN pay for Youtube Premium, Spotify and you\'re already tracked from many sources ü§∑ !
