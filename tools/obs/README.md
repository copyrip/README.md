Ten years ago, almost by the day, this post on the r/starcraft subreddit, might just have changed the course of media history. (Have a look at the top comment though 👀 !)

Open Broadcaster Software is the backbone of our contemporary video streaming landscape.
This is OUR Gutemberg Press revolution 💪 ! (Well, calm down Hot Tub McLuhan 🤦 ) This soft, helped by the RTMP protocol to be fair, gave so many people the opportunity to express themselves via streaming.

I'm amazed that this journey started off the simple will of a gamer to stream his games !

OBS is kind of a backronym, it takes its name frome the Starcraft "Protos Observer", a stealth unit from the famous Blizzard RTS game, so you might just call it Obssss, rather than O.B.S. That's how Hugh Bailey, its creator, calls it anyways...👾

As OBS is an open-source software, you can find its code in many other applications (such as TikTok, Streamlabs, etc. ) ... and it's ok ! That's even one of the purpose of free software. What's not OK though is infriging copyright and that StreamLabs tried to launch its service as StreamLabs OBS. “The team at @streamlabs should be ashamed. Not satisfied enough to ride @OBSProject’s hard work.” stated one of OBS developers, and I agree.

Keep using OBS, keep streaming, keep sharing your views and ideas via cyberspace 👏! Thank your for your service 🎖️
