Did u know Etherpad was acquired by google in 2008 ? 🤔

There is a quirky tale about free software an open source licensing from these days... 📜
Etherpad, which was spelled EtherPad at the time, was using the 'jsmin-php' library (a port of Douglas Crawford JSmin) in order to minify and unminify javascript code. But the library was published under an alternative MIT license, which icluded the following →

    ☯️ "The software shall be used for good, not evil" 👼👿

The library was promptly removed from G\*ogle Code (which only hosted truly "free" software), and google asked EtherPad dev to find an alternative library in order to publish the source code under the Apache License in 2009. The main argument is that enforcing "no to do evil" isn't considerer free software pratice: it limits arbitrarily the reach of the final user ! What's ur opinion about that ? ☝️

Today we take collaborative editing of a document for granted, but as so many features of our modern internet, there is an history behind it.
Editing a online file with multiple cursors seems pretty common nowadays. But *pads* had to be i n v e n t e d 💡

Etherpad's principle are quite simple. Each "pad" has a unique URL, a lifetime, access management, a version history and an integrated chat. It has classic formating options and can be edited simultaneously via various users. There are also pugins available, like a video call one, illustrated with a fake call between the 🎺 whistleblower Edward Snowden and the free software prodigy Linus Torvalds 🐧

With the rise of web 2.0 and plateform econony, we tend to associate a software with a company. But as an open source software, Etherpad is installed in so many places, by various people for different purpose. Here is a small list of websites where you can host your own pads ↓

I know, the website is still messy, but i'm working on it!
