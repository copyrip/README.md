Did u know Etherpad was acquired by google in 2008 ? ðŸ¤”
There is a quirky tale about free software an open source licensing from these days...
Etherpad, which was spelled EtherPad at the time, was using the 'jsmin-php' library (a port of Douglas Crawford JSmin) in order to minify and unminify javascript code.

The main argument is that enforcing "no to do evil" isn't considerer free software pratice: it limits arbitrarily the reach of the final user ! 


Today we take collaborative editing of a document for granted, but as so many features of our modern internet, there is an history behind it.
Editing a online file with multiple cursors seems pretty common nowadays. But *pads* had to be i n v e n t e d.

Etherpad's principle are quite simple. Each "pad" has a unique URL, a lifetime, access management, a version history and an integrated chat. It has classic formating options and can be edited simultaneously via various users. There are also pugins available, like a video call one, illustrated with a fake call between the whistleblower Edward Snowden and the free software prodigy Linus Torvalds.

With the rise of web 2.0 and plateform econony, we tend to associate a software with a company. But as an open source software, Etherpad is installed in so many places, by various people for different purpose. Here is a small list of websites where you can host your own pads.
