😵‍💫 for all the software of this advent calendar, Duck Duck Go has to be the one with the shittier name: it will be abreviated DDG in this document. It was created in 2008 by Gabriel Weinberg, a web entrepreneur 🤓

🦆 DDG is an *hybrid* search engine, as it relies on various vendors API (Bing, primarly) But it doesn't store anything on you, doesn't monitor you: it is what a search engine should be (a search engine). It provides unfiltered results, and promises to get you out of your filter bubble 🧋

For the majority of your searches David, it turns out, is just as good as Goliath, but what I like about DDG is that a lot of other websites are on the tip of my finger 🤌 Nowadays, internet is quite well indexed 📇 and many of our online searches are quite simply answered: being a restaurant, the wikipedia page of some obscure person or the notice for a random gadget.

Event though I advocate for a shift in computer usage and understanding, I'm quite used to google products 🤦
Every single time I'm looking for something online this go as follows:
* i switch to firefox 🦊
* i open a new tab (ctrl+t)
* i type "my question"
* → followed by a duck duck go MODIFIER
* !g is for google
* !gi is for google images
* !gm for google maps
* !gn for google news (never understood that one)
* !f for .. flickr ! lol
* !w is for wikipedia
* !wfr is for the french version
* !rapgenius is for .. well of course
* !ig for instagram (what can u even search on there ?)
* !a for amazon
* !afr for amazon france
* and so on...
* (there are more than 13,000 !)

So one might argue that I'm not reaaallly using the 🦆 duck duck go search engine: and I'm not (for my defense it is almost as shitty as their name 🙅)

I strongly recommend your start applying these good pratices on a daily basis. It is quite simple to start. Just select DDG as your default search engine on your web browser (we'll talk about Firefox soonish). Forget you've changed from google and start getting unusual results... then remember what I told you:

    while using duckduckgo, the "!g" modifier you shall add to every request !

It is also recommended to browse the web with their ➕ addon btw.

P.S: you can access the website via the url ddg.gg ^^
