[Graph Commons](http://graphcommons.com) is a powerful online structured graphing tool 📈 (while you can find its source code on [github]("https://github.com/graphcommons/"), they developed a [pricing model](https://graphcommons.com/plans): the free option already gives plenty of room to play around).

I use it mainly for to investigate and understand complex relationship structures between " t h i n g s " (people, institutions, documents, whatever). I guess you could also use it for structure mind-mapping, and try to de·organize everything that's on your mind.

As I'm writing my [master thesis](https://graphcommons.com/graphs/0e779a22-46d3-448d-8dac-de089ae3a6df) at [erg](http://erg.be), 🌱 the rhizomatic visualisation of all the themes and things I want to include is crucial. But be careful, it's just way too easy to find [links and meaning everywhere](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia) 🤯
