This as to be one of my best kept secret tools.
I've never felt I was good at writing (just have a read of theses description...) 
Few years ago, deep into various productivity techniques and methods, I stumbled accross an "app" with an intruiguing name → The Most Dangerous Writing App

Well, behind this putaclic name, was just a simple minimalist online text editor "with a twist" ... if you stop writing for too long, your whole work dissapears :zipper:

There are various options such as a timer (i like to use the 5mn one, just to get into the right headspace)

The app was bought (?)  by ... media ... and I don't really understant why (not that I care for that matter).

My stance on productivity enhancment tools in a productivity driven world where "everything is content" ? As for any tools, it doesnt encapsulate no moral fallacies → it's just HOW you use it that's important IMHO.

If you're using pomodoro tools, productivity trackers and tools, in order to write the next anarchist manifesto that'll radicalize TikTok users all around the world, have a go !

If you're using it to bootlick your boss and to get into the copywriting business to enhance the SEO of your shitty dropshipped non FDA approved product → you might be event using the superio vim editor I'll not be pleased :rage:
